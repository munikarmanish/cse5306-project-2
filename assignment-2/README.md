Requirements
------------

- Python >= 3.6


Usage
-----

First start the server in a terminal:

    $ python3 main.py


By default, it will spawn 3 processes each of which will generate 3 events.
So the output should show that each process has processed 9 events. You can
terminate the program with CTRL-C once all the events are processed.
